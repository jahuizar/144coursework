# Do you like how we format text on GitHub? Use Mou.

Many of you are familiar with markup languages like HTML and LaTeX, but as you know, it's not very readable as plain text. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is another one of these markup languages, but when you use it, you'll produce plain text documents that you can read easily whether they get typeset with their fancy formatting or not. Scroll to the bottom of this page and look at the raw source to see what I mean. Interested? After reading a [short tutorial like this one](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/markdown-the-ins-and-outs/), you'll be a pro.

If you take class notes on your computer, you might consider taking them in Markdown. (I do.) You can write Markdown in any plain text editor, but there are also tons of good Markdown clients that show you both what you're writing in plain text and the styled document at the same time (without refreshing like HTML or compiling like LaTeX, if you use those).

### Recommendation: Mou for Mac

For Mac users just getting started with Markdown, I recommend an app called [Mou](http://mouapp.com/). It's free and easy to use, but it has a lot of non-basic features if you need them later.

### Keeping Markdown notes together

If you get really into using Markdown specifically to take notes, you can also consider a free app called [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) (an **ALT**ernative version of another project called **N**otational **V**elocity). nvALT is a searchable notebook with a built-in Markdown engine, so you can keep all your Markdown-formatted notes together and file through them at a moment's notice.

**PROTIP:** For the [`org-mode`](http://orgmode.org/) groupies in the room: There's an implementation of the Notational Velocity notebook idea called [`org velocity`](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-velocity.html).

### Not just for Mac users

This document is Mac-focused because that's what I'm most familiar with, but Markdown is agressively cross-platform. Do any of you use it on other systems? Give me your recommendations and I'll add them here.
