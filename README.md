##### 2013-10-08

Added the material from today's section to the 'sections' folder above. There's a filled version and a "worksheet" version with only the instructions. There's also an IPython notebook file of each, and a plain .py file.

##### 2013-10-04

Added a quick guide for [using Markdown](Using Markdown.md) to take class notes. (By the way, I'm not really going to put my solutions in that homework file up there.)

[Click here](Setup instructions.md) to see my detailed instructions for seting up Github and IPython Notebook. Good luck on HW1!
